## What is the Problem That We Are Solving?

Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) represents a rapidly growing segment within the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) market, currently accounting for 45% of the total carbon removals market. This market is projected by McKinsey to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.4%, reaching an estimated value of $1.2 trillion by 2050 (Source 2). Despite its significant potential, BECCS faces critical challenges that hinder its growth and adoption.

One of the primary issues confronting BECCS companies is the complexity of carbon accounting and the difficulty in effectively communicating this intricate process to stakeholders. Currently, prospective clients and government officials must either navigate through insufficiently detailed project summaries or sift through dozens of technical PDF reports, each approximately 50 pages long, to understand a project's carbon removal credentials (Source 2). This complexity creates barriers in client acquisition, stakeholder engagement, and securing governmental subsidies, all of which are essential for the financial viability and scalability of BECCS projects.

Moreover, BECCS companies typically rely on two main sales channels: bilateral deals and marketplace sales, with bilateral deals constituting the majority of their current revenue streams (Source 2). The median deal size for the top six BECCS companies is approximately $1,050,000, with carbon credits priced around $300 each (Source 2). Given the substantial financial stakes involved, even a modest improvement in the probability of securing deals can significantly impact a company's revenue. For instance, a 10% increase in the likelihood of closing just one additional deal per year could equate to an additional $100,000 in revenue (Source 2).

Additionally, BECCS projects face considerable public relations and transparency challenges. Stakeholders, including government officials and potential clients, demand clear, transparent, and easily accessible information regarding the sourcing of biomass feedstock and the overall sustainability of BECCS projects (Source 2). For example, traceability issues have arisen in cases such as the Drax power plant, where wood pellets sourced from Canadian forests become mixed at shipping depots, complicating transparency efforts (Source 2). Conversely, companies like Elimini, which exclusively use virgin wood from local tree farms, emphasize traceability as a core component of their operations (Source 2). This disparity highlights the critical need for robust transparency and traceability solutions within the BECCS supply chain.

Furthermore, BECCS companies face significant market risks associated with long-term contracts, including price fluctuations and regulatory uncertainties (Source 2). The complexity of these projects requires extensive legal, financial, and technical expertise, further complicating stakeholder communication and project management (Source 2). Additionally, there is a pressing need to optimize supply chain logistics, from biomass collection and transportation to storage, to minimize costs and waste (Source 2).

Finally, the broader carbon offset market faces ethical concerns, with critics arguing that current offset practices often merely delay environmental damage rather than addressing its root causes (Source 1). This skepticism underscores the importance of transparent, verifiable, and easily communicable carbon accounting practices to build trust and credibility among stakeholders.

In summary, the core problem we are addressing is the absence of specialized, effective tools for BECCS companies to transparently and efficiently communicate complex carbon accounting processes to non-expert stakeholders. This communication gap negatively impacts sales, stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance, and public perception, ultimately limiting the growth and scalability of BECCS as a critical carbon removal technology.
