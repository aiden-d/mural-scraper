## Technical Product Specification: AI-Powered Business Plan Drafting CLI Tool

### Overview
Develop a simplified Python command-line interface (CLI) tool that generates business plan drafts by identifying relevant information from Mural board embeddings based on user-pasted business plan section specifications.

### Key Features & Components

#### 1. Authentication
- **OpenAI Authentication**
  - Simple authentication using OpenAI's API key.
  - Utilize GPT-4.5 model.
  - Store API keys securely in environment variables.

- **Mural Authentication**
  - Basic API token-based authentication with Mural.
  - Store credentials securely for reuse.

#### 2. Project Selection
- Display a straightforward list of Mural projects in the CLI.
- Allow the user to select a project numerically.
- Save selected project details locally as a simple JSON file for future convenience.

#### 3. Context Retrieval & Processing
- Fetch and embed Mural board content via the Mural API.
- Utilize embeddings to search and retrieve relevant content based on pasted section descriptions from the user.
- Implement lightweight semantic search to quickly identify related elements from the mural embeddings.

#### 4. Business Plan Drafting
- User pastes or inputs a brief specification or title of each business plan section directly in the CLI.
- Tool automatically retrieves relevant embedded Mural elements and constructs a prompt to generate the corresponding section draft using GPT-4.5.
- Output AI-generated business plan sections directly to the terminal.
- Optionally export results to plaintext or Markdown files.

### Technical Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher.
- Minimal dependencies listed clearly in a simple `requirements.txt` file.
- Code structure prioritizes simplicity and clarity (single main script with minimal modularization).
- Clear, concise user messages and simple error handling.

### Deliverables
- Single Python script file.
- Brief, clear documentation for setup and use.
- Example outputs and usage instructions.
